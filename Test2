So this file content is not so simple because it contains additions and extension
But I wanted to add new lines to it from branch one because it is better

But I would like to extend the contents of this file. 
It is important, because if we do not add these lines than it 
will not be sufficient and sophisticated enough 
So we add those lines
Added a line in the middle

So we add here some more lines as additions
These additions are really nice because they make the text richer
So these are really good

Just add this simple line
This line has been added with nano on ubuntu
I need to merge this back to the original

After the merge I'll further modify the file. 
I've fetched from Ubuntu-Changes and I wonder If I can upload it there or rather to the master

But what will happen if I make this change elsewhere????
And if I change this on Ubuntu?
